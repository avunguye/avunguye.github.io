### Introduction to Poisson Regression:
- Poisson regression is a generalized linear model form of regression analysis used to model count data.
    - Count data: a type of data in which the observations can take only the counting numbers, non-negative integer values (0, 1, 2, 3,...). These integers arise from counting rather than ranking.

- Poisson regression model:
        $log(\lambda_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}$

### Poisson Regression Assumptions
- Poisson Response: The response variable is a count per unit of time or space, described by a Poisson distribution.
- Independence: The observations must be independent of one another.
- Mean = Variance: By definition, the mean of a Poisson random variable must be equal to its variance.
- Linearity: The log of the mean rate, $log(\lambda)$, must be a linear function of x.



## When Poisson Regression should be used:
- Poisson regression, also known as a log-linear model, should be used when the outcome variable is count data.
- Examples: 
   - how many heart attacks or strokes one’s had.
   
   ![heart attacks/strokes](aug-2021-capsule2-drawing-heart.jpg){#id .class width=20% height=20%}
   - how many days in the past month one’s used [insert your favorite illicit    substance here].
   
   ![weed](marijuana-485493063-650x428.jpg){#id .class width=20% height=20%}
   - how many days from outbreak until infection.

## Two Sample Scenarios with A Snip of Data Structure (1):
- Sample Scenario 1: Predict the number of awards earned by a student in high school based on the program they enrolled in and their math final exam score.

```{r echo = FALSE}
award <- read.csv("poisson_sim.csv")
award <- within(award, {prog <- factor(prog, levels=1:3, labels=c("General", "Academic", "Vocational"))
                id <- factor(id)
})

head(award, 12)
```

## Two Sample Scenarios with A Snip of Data Structure (2):
- Sample Scenario 2: Predict the number of warp breaks per loom based on the effect of wool type (A or B) and tension (low, medium, or high).

```{r echo = F}
breaks <- warpbreaks
head(breaks, 12)
```
